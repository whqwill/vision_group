So, if you would like to work on object recognition from street scenes, the job is available for you. As a first task, you would work on this dataset: http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php, and compare recognition performance of several methods, probably starting with appearance based. Later on, we could work on improving the results, extending the topic towards master thesis would probably be possible too. For us, it would be best if you could start working after 14th of March, when our ECCV deadlines are over (in the first two weeks of March I will be really busy).
