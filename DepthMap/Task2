this result is not ok yet, I can only see noise. For reference, I am
attaching one reference image and corresponding disparity map (using
my current algorithm) - as you can see, disp. map is not perfect, but
at least it roughly resembles the correct depth. You should get
similar results, even slightly better ones.

So, check your code again, maybe some parameters are wrong, maybe
there are some assumptions for input data that you didn't consider...

By the way, I checked if the problem could be in rectification - but
it is not. Kitti data is already rectified, so that must be fine.

You can also try StereoBM first, for reference. Actually it would be
good idea to do so, so you can see how much result improves when you
use StereoSGBM method (the semi-global matching). I would be also
interested to see the difference.
